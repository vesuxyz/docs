In this section of the user's guide, we are going to explore how to withdraw your assets from a market.

Make sure you are connected to the app before you proceed. See how [here](./connect.md).

1. To get started, ensure you already have a position created by supplying to the market. You can see how to do that [here](./supply.md).

2. To withdraw, head to the position whose assets you'll like to withdraw and click on the "Close" button.
