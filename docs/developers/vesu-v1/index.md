# Welcome to the Vesu V1 Developer Documentation

:::info
The Vesu V1 lending protocol has evolved into a new implementation, the Vesu V2 protocol, that offers even more security to users.
:::

The Vesu V1 lending protocol is the first version of our fully open and permissionless lending markets for Starknet. It launched on Starknet mainnet on July 2024 and has operated 24/7/365 ever since. Here you find all relevant information if you are looking to build on Vesu or just want to dig into implementation details.
