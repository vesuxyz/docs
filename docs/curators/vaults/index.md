# Getting started as a vault curator

Vesu Vaults empower curators to set up and manage yield strategies on top of Vesu lending pools and other DeFi protocols. Vesu Vaults follow a modular architecture allowing for a wide range of yield strategies with minimal trust assumptions towards the curator and strategy manager. This enables curators to design strategies for different use cases from "simple" basis trades to BTCfi and levered yield farming.

## Getting started

We recommend curators to first read the basics of Vesu Vaults [here](/curators/vaults/basics). If you have questions around curating Vaults, get in touch with our Support [here](https://discord.com/invite/G9Gxgujj8T).

If you are ready to launch your first Vesu Vault, proceed with the following guides:

1. Create your first Vesu Vault as explained [here](/curators/vaults/create-vault).
2. Manage liquidity and allocations of your Vesu Vault as explained [here](/curators/vaults/manage-vault).

## Vault listing

Vesu Vaults is a permissionless protocol and allows anyone to set up and curate yield strategies. However, for quality and security reasons, Vesu Vaults need to go through a listing process in order to be included on the Vesu website. This process is currently manual and involves the following steps:

1. Collect and review curator information
2. Collect and review strategy information
3. Whitelisting of the Vault on the Vesu App
