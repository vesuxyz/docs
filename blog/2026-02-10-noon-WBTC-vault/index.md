![WBTC yield powered by Noon Vaults](noon-wbtc-vault.png)

Bitcoin yield on Starknet keeps growing.

After the success of the first Noon vault, a new WBTC vault is now live.

It brings an automated yield strategy to Bitcoin, without selling or manual position management.

## The Noon WBTC Vault

Deposit WBTC. The strategy takes it from there.

Stablecoins are borrowed against the deposited Bitcoin and deployed into **sUSN**, Noon’s yield-bearing stablecoin. The position is managed automatically using conservative leverage and rules-based adjustments.

All funds remain **non-custodial** and fully **transparent onchain**.

The curator targets around **10% APY**.

## About Noon and sUSN

Noon builds stablecoin yield strategies focused on sustainability and risk management.

USN is backed 1:1 by a mix of USDT, USDC, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Its staked version, sUSN, accrues yield natively in the token.

Noon has been live for over a year with zero downtime and no security incidents. The protocol has been audited by firms including Halborn, Hashlock, and Quantstamp.

As with any DeFi strategy, make sure you understand the risks and do your own research.

## Vesu Vaults

Vesu Vaults make advanced onchain strategies accessible without the usual complexity.

Each vault runs a strict onchain mandate and is operated by an independent curator. Funds can only be used within clearly defined strategy boundaries, and performance is fully transparent onchain.

The Vesu Vaults framework has undergone multiple independent audits. Full details are available in the [Vesu docs](https://docs.vesu.xyz/explore/vaults).
