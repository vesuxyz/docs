We’re thrilled to welcome Alterscope as a new curator on Vesu! 

Alterscope has earned its reputation for expertise in risk management and data-driven analytics, driving security and innovation across DeFi ecosystems. Their expertise is already integrated into Starknet, providing transparent insights and a clear view of the network’s mechanics. Explore their Starknet analytics [here](https://app.alterscope.org/projects/starknet/layer2(zk)/chain#analytics).

They’re launching with multiple new curated pools, each designed to optimize capital efficiency and expand borrowing options. Let’s check them out!

## Alterscope CASH Pool
**Collateral:** ETH, STRK, USDC, USDT, WBTC  
**Borrow:** CASH

This pool brings the CASH stablecoin to Vesu, unlocking new ways to borrow against key assets. For example, deposit USDC as collateral to borrow CASH—letting you retain exposure to USDC’s yield opportunities while accessing fresh liquidity to use as you like.
