The wstETH contract has been updated by the Starknet Foundation due to the need for a new bridge contract. This change ensures continued compatibility and security for users interacting with wstETH on Starknet.

## Key Points for Users:
- Your wstETH (legacy) position can be accessed via [lite.vesu.xyz](https://lite.vesu.xyz/)
- Your balance remains the same. The migration only updates the token contract.
- During migration, your entire wstETH (legacy) wallet balance will be converted.
- The new wstETH is supported in all major Starknet DeFi protocols.
- Check the official wstETH Migration Hub by the Starknet Foundation for more information [here](https://wstethmigration.starknet.io/).

## How to migrate

1. Close your position on [lite.vesu.xyz](https://lite.vesu.xyz)
2. Migrate your wstETH via the official [wstETH Migration Hub](https://wstethmigration.starknet.io/)
3. Reopen your position on [vesu.xyz](https://vesu.xyz/) using the new wstETH.
