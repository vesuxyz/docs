This page gives an overview of the vault Tokens' storage architecture and available functions.

vTokens are shares of the underlying asset in a pool. A conversion rate determines the asset amount a user can redeem for the vTokens, and during deposit, how much vToken the user gets after depositing the assets.

Our vTokens follow the ERC4626 standard and we encourage to check the [SNIP](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/pull/95) we created.

Check [here](https://github.com/vesuxyz/vesu-v1/blob/main/src/v_token.cairo) the full source code.

## Storage

The following section shows each storage variable available in the vToken contract.

#### erc20

Storing the ERC20 specific storage variables

```
erc20: ERC20Component::Storage
```

#### pool_id

The id of the pool in which the vToken's underlying asset is deposited into

```
pool_id: felt252
```

#### extension

The vToken is linked to an pool, each pool has an extension, this storage variable stores the extension of this pool.

```
extension: ContractAddress
```

#### asset

The underlying asset of the vToken

```
asset: ContractAddress
```

#### is_legacy

Flag indicating whether the asset is a legacy ERC20 token using camelCase or snake_case

```
is_legacy: bool
```

## Functions

### extension

Returns the address of the extension associated with the vToken

#### Returns

- address of the extension

```
fn extension(self: @ContractState) -> ContractAddress
```

```
fn pool_id(self: @ContractState) -> felt252

```

### burn_v_token

Permissioned burning of vTokens. Can only be called by the associated extension.
`from` needs to approve the extension to burn the vToken.
