Vesu users can earn additional rewards through ecosystem programs on Starknet.

## BTCfi Season
A new era of Bitcoin liquidity is coming to Starknet.  

The Starknet Foundation’s **BTCfi Season** will launch soon, designed to:  
- Bring Bitcoin liquidity to Starknet  
- Create efficient markets for BTC assets  
- Open new opportunities for Bitcoin users  

Vesu will be part of the program, details **TBA**.  


## DeFi Spring
The Starknet Foundation allocates STRK rewards to participating protocols, such as Vesu, based on a set of activity metrics. These metrics determine the weekly distribution of STRK tokens to each protocol. For more information, visit the official [DeFi Spring](https://defispring.starknet.io/about) page.

### How can I earn STRK on Vesu?
Simply supply assets to any of the [eligible markets](#which-markets-are-eligible).

:::note
According to the Starknet Foundation’s criteria, only non-recursive deposits of stablecoins (USDC/USDT) are eligible for STRK rewards. For example, if you deposit USDC and borrow USDT, you’ll still earn the organic Supply APY on your USDC, but you won’t receive any extra STRK rewards due to the USDT debt.

### How is my STRK allocation determined?

Your allocation of STRK tokens depends on two factors:

1. The total amount of STRK distributed to Vesu is based on a set of metrics that are defined and monitored by the Starknet Foundation.
2. Your share is determined by the value of your deposited assets relative to the total value locked (TVL) across all participants in eligible markets over a given period.

You can track your total interest earnings (across all markets) on the [Vesu Leaderboard](./leaderboard.md).
