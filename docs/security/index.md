# Security

We take security of the Vesu lending protocol and liquidity supplied therein very seriously.

This is why we have partnered with leading DeFi security experts like

- [Chain Security](https://www.chainsecurity.com)
- [Cairo Security Clan](https://cairosecurityclan.com)
- [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com)

You can find all audit reports and verification hashes in the [Audit Overview](./audits.md).

Please submit any bug/vulnerability report through our [Bug Bounty Program](https://immunefi.com).
For further inquiries please reach out to [security@vesu.xyz](mailto:security@vesu.xyz).

If the [Vesu website](https://vesu.xyz) is ever unavailable, funds remain safe and accessible on Starknet.  
You can also use the [Lite Frontend](https://lite.vesu.xyz) to view positions, withdraw or repay assets,  
and access deprecated assets, i.e. sSTRK, not shown on the main site.
