## Summary

The *Vesu rUSDC Re7 rUSDC* market represents `rUSDC` deposits in Re7 Lab's *Re7 rUSDC* pool.

The pool enables a variety of collateral assets, including `ETH`, `WBTC`, `USDC`, `STRK`, to borrow Relend's `rUSDC` stablecoin. 
It uses Vesu's official factory extension with Pragma price feeds.

The market's overall risk rating is 游릳 Medium.

## Pool Risk

The "Re7 rUSDC" pool is curated by Re7 Labs, a professional risk curator with extensive experience and a long track record on other lending protocols.

The pool uses Vesu's audited factory extension which uses a robust Pragma feed and Vesu's public liquidation model.

Re7 Labs has the permission to pause the pool in an emergency situation and update various parameters including debt caps and liquidation loan-to-value ratios. 

Given Re7 Labs' extensive risk curation experience and their operational setup, including a multisig and real-time monitoring with Hypernative, the pool risk is deemed low.

## Asset Risk

`rUSDC` is a USD-pegged stablecoin that is issued by the [Relend Network](https://relend.network) protocol. This protocol is developed and backed by the B.Protocol, a highly experienced and professional team with a long track record in DeFi.

Relend protocol implements a new stablecoin design, based on the `rUSDC` stablecoin which is mintable and redeemable with USDC on a 1:1 basis on Ethereum mainnet. Thus, `rUSDC` is fully backed and tightly pegged to USDC.

The Relend protocol further expands to `rUSDC-x` versions of the stablecoin that are bridged to and serve as liquidity for the respective chain, such as Starknet's `rUSDC-stark`. Isolated stability modules enable permissionless minting and redemption (on 1:1 basis with USDC) on Ethereum mainnet.

**Smart contract risk**

The Relend codebase (see links below) is open-source and audited twice by Certora and Fixed Point Solutions LLC (Kurt Barry).

Since it is a fairly new codebase without significant track record, a significant risk of unidentified bugs and vulnerabilities remains.

:::warning
The `rUSDC` contract on Starknet is not verified on block explorers.

**Counterparty risk**

N/A

**Depeg risk**

`rUSDC` is a new stablecoin with very limited price history making it difficult to assess the risk of a depeg.

On the other hand, `rUSDC` is redeemable to USDC on a 1:1 basis motivating a "fundamental" value of 1 `USDC` per `rUSDC` and thus strong price stability.

Furthermore, in the *Re7 rUSDC* pool `rUSDC` is enabled only as a loan asset, and not as collateral asset, and uses a the `USDC/USD` oracle price to mitigate temporary depegs due to (initially) low DEX liquidity on Starknet.

## Oracle Risk

The pool uses Pragma's `USDC/USD` price feed.
The Pragma oracle is a native Starknet oracle system that secures over USD 200m across all major projects on Starknet.
It is fully decentralized in that it does not rely on off-chain infrastructure. Instead, data providers directly push prices on-chain and aggregation is done by the data consumer directly.

**Smart contract risk**

Find an overview of the Pragma smart contract system [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle?tab=readme-ov-file#overview).

The Pragma smart contracts have been audited by Nethermind and both the [source code](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle) and [audit report](https://github.com/astraly-labs/pragma-oracle/tree/main/audits) are publicly available.

**Price composition & source diversity**

The oracle price is computed as the Median over the most recent data points available for the various Pragma providers.

**Oracle fail-safes**

N/A

Re7 Labs actively monitors the pool and oracle feeds and in case of an emergency pauses deposits and withdrawals.

## Market Risk

`rUSDC` deposits can be borrowed with any of pool's collateral assets, including `ETH`, `wstETH`, `WBTC`, `STRK`.

The pool enforces *debt caps* and *liquidation discounts* reflecting the on-chain liquidity available for liquidations.

Liquidations, facilitated by the official factory extension (see Section *Pool Risk*), are public and prioritize a rapid liquidation process.

The resulting market risk is computed using the [Standard Market Risk Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zU9IRKCX8xicSNd4UV78hMEw_rf-ZtGL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108086377410680948516&rtpof=true&sd=true).
