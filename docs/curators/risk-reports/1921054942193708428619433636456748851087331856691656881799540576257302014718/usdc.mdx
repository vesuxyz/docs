## Pool Risk

The *Braavos Vault* pool is curated by Braavos, one of Starknet's leading wallets with more than 1,000,000 active users.

The pool uses Vesu's audited factory extension which leverages a robust Pragma feed and Vesu's public liquidation model.

Braavos has the permission to pause the pool in an emergency situation and update various risk parameters. 

Given Braavos' reputation in the Starknet ecosystem and long track record in building, monitoring and managing Starknet infrastructure the pool risk is *Low*.

## Asset Risk

:::warning
This report does not assess the risks associated with bridging assets to Starknet using StarkGate.
Make sure you understand the risks involved with bridging assets to Starknet before continuing.
:::

StarkGate USDC reflects Ethereum mainnet USDC that is bridged to Starknet using the StarkGate bridge. 
StarkGate is Starknet's canonical bridge and is developed and maintained by StarkWare, the creator of Starknet.
The bridge is operational since early 2022 and has facilitated over [1.9M bridge transactions](https://dune.com/sapiens/starknet-insighttokenomics-and-bridge-stats) or over USD 1.7bn in value bridged.

**Smart contract risk**

StarkGate USDC uses OpenZeppelin's [standard ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts) token implementation.
It has been audited by Nethermind and both [source code](https://github.com/starknet-io/starkgate-contracts) and [audit report](https://github.com/NethermindEth/PublicAuditReports/blob/main/NM0064-DRAFT_STARKGATE.pdf) are publicly available.

:::warning
The StarkGate USDC contract is not verified on block explorers.

## Oracle Risk

The pool uses Pragma's `USDC/USD` price feed.
The Pragma oracle is a native Starknet oracle system that secures over USD 200m across all major projects on Starknet.
It is fully decentralized in that it does not rely on off-chain infrastructure. Instead, data providers directly push prices on-chain and aggregation is done by the data consumer directly.

**Smart contract risk**

Find an overview of the Pragma smart contract system [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle?tab=readme-ov-file#overview).

The Pragma smart contracts have been audited by Nethermind and both the [source code](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle) and [audit report](https://github.com/astraly-labs/pragma-oracle/tree/main/audits) are publicly available.

**Price composition & source diversity**

The oracle price is computed as the Median over the most recent data points available for the various Pragma providers.

**Oracle fail-safes**

The pool uses Vesu's autonomous *Emergency* features with the following requirements on Pragma's price feeds:
- a minimum of 3 price sources
- a maximum of 4 hours price update frequency

If any of these safety checks are violated, the pool will autonomously enter a pause mode protecting users from untrusted oracle prices.

## Market Risk

`USDC` deposits in this pool can be borrowed with `WBTC` as collateral.

The pool enforces *debt caps* and *liquidation discounts* reflecting the on-chain liquidity available for liquidations.

Liquidations, as per the used official factory extension, are public and prioritize rapid liquidations.

The resulting market risk is computed using the [Standard Market Risk Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zU9IRKCX8xicSNd4UV78hMEw_rf-ZtGL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108086377410680948516&rtpof=true&sd=true).
