## Summary

StarkGate Ether (ETH) is the bridged version of Ether (ETH) on Starknet using the StarkGate bridge.

StarkGate is the canonical bridging protocol of Starknet developed and maintained by StarkWare, the creator of Starknet. 

ETH has an MCAP of over USD 400bn and TVL on Starknet of over USD 200m.

## Pool Risk

This pool uses the factory extension that was audited by ChainSecurity together with the Vesu protocol.

The extension implements a robust liquidation model, adaptive interest rates and various fail-safes intended
to protect user's assets in various stress scenarios.

The extension currently allows the pool owner to update various pool configuration without giving it control over user's assets.
These permissions are planned to be revoked once the pool has stabilized.

## Asset Risk

:::warning
This report does not assess the risks associated with bridging assets to Starknet using StarkGate.
Make sure you understand the risks involved with bridging assets to Starknet before continuing.
:::

StarkGate ETH reflects Ethereum mainnet ETH that is bridged to Starknet using the StarkGate bridge. 
StarkGate is Starknet's canonical bridge and is developed and maintained by StarkWare, the creator of Starknet.
The bridge is operational since early 2022 and has facilitated over [1.9M bridge transactions](https://dune.com/sapiens/starknet-insighttokenomics-and-bridge-stats) or over USD 1.7bn in value bridged.

**Smart contract risk**

StarkGate ETH uses OpenZeppelin's [standard ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts) token implementation.
It has been audited by Nethermind and both [source code](https://github.com/starknet-io/starkgate-contracts) and [audit report](https://github.com/NethermindEth/PublicAuditReports/blob/main/NM0064-DRAFT_STARKGATE.pdf) are publicly available.

:::warning
The StarkGate ETH contract is not verified on block explorers.

## Oracle Risk

The asset's oracle implementation relies on a Pragma price feed.
The Pragma oracle is a native Starknet oracle system that secures over USD 200m across all major projects on Starknet.
It is fully decentralized in that it does not rely on off-chain infrastructure. Instead, data providers directly push prices on-chain and aggregation is done by the data consumer directly.

**Smart contract risk**

Find an overview of the Pragma smart contract system [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle?tab=readme-ov-file#overview).
The Pragma smart contracts have been audited by Nethermind and both the [source code](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle) and [audit report](https://github.com/astraly-labs/pragma-oracle/tree/main/audits) are publicly available.

**Price composition & timeliness**

Pragma oracle price feeds use a variety of price providers and sources including on-chain and off-chain sources. 
The resulting price is derived from the various sources using the Median aggregator. 

**Oracle fail-safes**

The pool extension's Pragma oracle feed integration implements different fail-safes to account for oracle failures:

- Staleness: If the latest price (across all active providers) is older than 4 hours, the oracle price is rejected 
- Robustness: If the number of responsive price providers is less than 4, the oracle price is rejected

In case the oracle price is rejected due to any of the above criteria, the pool transitions into a pause mode preventing possible exploits due to unreliable oracle prices.

## Market Risk

The lending pool enables borrowing of StarkGate ETH deposits using any of the other pool assets as collateral.
The pool extension implements a robust [liquidation strategy](https://docs.vesu.xyz) that optimizes for rapid liquidations also in a stressed market environment.
Nonetheless, a residual risk for bad debt from failed liquidations exists. 
In such a scenario, accrued bad debt is instantaneously allocated to the lenders in the pool.

The asset's market risk is computed using the [Standard Market Risk Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zU9IRKCX8xicSNd4UV78hMEw_rf-ZtGL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108086377410680948516&rtpof=true&sd=true).

**Rating**

The proposed rating is:

- 🟩 Low


## Collateral Risk

The pool enables asset *Rehypothecation* which means that borrowers' collateral assets too serve as liquidity in the pool.
The collateral chain thus spans across all pool assets resulting in that StarkGate ETH inherits the highest severity risk among all these assets.

The proposed rating is:

- 🟩 Low
