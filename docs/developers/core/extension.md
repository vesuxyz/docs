## Extension Interface

The following functions need to be implemented for a valid extension contract.

You can also check the interface here on [Github](https://github.com/vesuxyz/vesu-v1/blob/main/src/extension/interface.cairo).

### singleton

Returns the address of the singleton contract

##### Returns

- `singleton` - address of the singleton contract

```
fn singleton(
        self: @TContractState
    ) -> ContractAddress;
```

### price

Returns the price for a given asset in a given pool.

This hook can be used to fetch the current price of either a supply or debt asset. The implementation of this hook is vital to the operation of the market as failure to appropriately implement fail-safes can lead to dangerous outcomes for the users' funds.

##### Arguments

- `pool_id` - id of the pool
- `asset` - address of the asset

##### Returns

- `AssetPrice` - latest price of the asset and its validity

```
fn price(
        self: @TContractState,
        pool_id: felt252,
        asset: ContractAddress
    ) -> AssetPrice;
```

### interest_rate

This hook can be used to calculate the accrued interest on a position. Vesu remains agnostic towards these, giving developers the freedom to innovate.

##### Arguments

- `pool_id` - id of the pool
- `asset` - address of the asset
- `utilization` - utilization of the asset
- `last_updated` - last time the interest rate was updated
- `last_full_utilization_rate` - The interest value when utilization is 100% [SCALE]

##### Returns

- `interest_rate` - current interest rate

```
fn interest_rate(
        self: @TContractState,
        pool_id: felt252,
        asset: ContractAddress,
        utilization: u256,
        last_updated: u64,
        last_full_utilization_rate: u256,
    ) -> u256;
```

### rate_accumulator

Called prior to every position change and effectively asks the extension to compute and collect interest on all positions.

##### Arguments

- `pool_id` - id of the pool
- `asset` - address of the asset
- `utilization` - utilization of the asset
- `last_updated` - last time the interest rate was updated
- `last_rate_accumulator` - last rate accumulator
- `last_full_utilization_rate` - the interest value when utilization is 100% [SCALE]

##### Returns

- `rate_accumulator` - current rate accumulator
- `last_full_utilization_rate` - the interest value when utilization is 100% [SCALE]

```
fn rate_accumulator(
        self: @TContractState,
        pool_id: felt252,
        asset: ContractAddress,
        utilization: u256,
        last_updated: u64,
        last_rate_accumulator: u256,
        last_full_utilization_rate: u256,
    ) -> (u256, u256);
```
