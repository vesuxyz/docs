This guide walks you through opening and closing a Multiply position.

## Opening a Position
Use Multiply to increase your exposure and yield for a specific asset.

1. Go to [vesu.xyz/multiply](https://vesu.xyz/multiply) and pick a market. 
   Use the filters to choose your collateral/borrow pair. You can also show only tokens in your wallet, or filter by curator and pool.

2. On the market page, check the key info for that pair:    
   Net APR, max multiplier, liquidity, liquidation price, and loan-to-value.

3. Enter your **deposit** and choose the **Net APR**.   
   The borrow amount is calculated automatically from your multiplier. Make sure youâ€™re comfortable with the shown monthly yield/cost, liquidation price, and LTV.
