![Vesu Migration](migration_success.png)

**Vesu has successfully completed a planned migration to address a security related disclosure and strengthen the protocol's long-term security.**  

## What this means for you 

All funds are safe and positions continue to work as expected, earn interest and DeFi Spring rewards.

Earn positions will show a ‘Migrate’ button, allowing users to migrate to new vTokens. In certain Starknet wallets like Argent Mobile, this migration happens automatically with your next interaction with Vesu.

## Why we migrated
As protocols grow, so does the complexity of maintaining and securing them.
This migration addresses a bug responsibly disclosed through Immunefi and resolved in close collaboration with Chainsecurity, our curators, and wallet partners.

 User funds are safe, and the fix is now fully implemented through this migration. Vesu continues to operate normally.

Thanks to Chainsecurity, Immunefi, and our partners across the Starknet ecosystem for making this transition seamless.
