Bitcoin isn’t just a store of value anymore. It’s becoming the foundation for a new financial layer, one where BTC itself can earn, move, and work across chains. Lombard makes this possible with LBTC, a liquid, yield-bearing version of BTC that brings native Bitcoin yield into DeFi.  

And now on Vesu, LBTC goes even further. You can earn, borrow, or multiply your position directly on Starknet, the home of permissionless BTCFi.

## Earn passive yield

Earn >2% APR on your LBTC deposit. Two pools by Re7 Labs are currently available.

**Re7 xBTC**  
This pool is built to Multiply staked Bitcoin. Deposited LBTC earns BTCFi rewards and organic yield driven by user-demand from Multiply and Borrow.

**Re7 USDC Core**  
The LBTC you deposit is not lent out, and can be withdrawn anytime. It earns BTCFi rewards while continuing to accrue staking rewards via Lombard.

## Borrow stablecoins at top rates

Use your LBTC as collateral to borrow USDC within the Re7 USDC Core pool. It’s the easiest way to unlock liquidity without selling your Bitcoin.

Your borrowed USDC stays flexible. Use it to farm additional yield on Vesu, buy more Bitcoin, or spend it with the Ready Card.

## Multiply your Bitcoin

Boost your Bitcoin exposure with other BTC assets for up to 30% APY.

The Re7 xBTC pool is designed to multiply staked Bitcoin. Users can supply xLBTC, the staked version of LBTC on Starknet, to increase exposure and staking rewards. Available as debt assets are LBTC, tBTC, SolvBTC, and WBTC. The correlated setup helps smooth volatility and improve stability for positions.

## Make more with your Bitcoin

Vesu turns LBTC into productive collateral. Earn consistent yield, access stable liquidity at top rates, or multiply your exposure.  

The hardest asset deserves the highest security. Every line of Vesu’s smart contracts has been [audited by multiple independent firms](https://docs.vesu.xyz/security/audits). The protocol also runs a [$100K Immunefi bug bounty](https://docs.vesu.xyz/security/bounties). If the main interface is ever unavailable, users can still manage their positions through Vesu's [lite frontend](https://lite.vesu.xyz/), ensuring full access to funds at all times.  

Vesu is built for those who want their Bitcoin to do more: **to stay self-custodial, secure, and earning while remaining entirely onchain**.  

It’s time to put your LBTC to work.
