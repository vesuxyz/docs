For security reasons, the core contracts of the Vesu V2 protocol have been made upgradeable. At a future time, permissions to upgrade will be revoked in favor of full decentralization. Until then, in order to ensure safety of the Vesu users and Starknet ecosystem, we have assigned governance over the upgrade permissions to the __Vesu Security Council__, a multisig account with 4-o-6 signer threshold and 50% highly reputed external signers.

You can find the Vesu Security Council under this Starknet mainnet address: [0x024b295eED808e3F3160E17AB424a59921F18ee2b1327E4615a5902D12bC9403](https://voyager.online/contract/0x024b295eed808e3f3160e17ab424a59921f18ee2b1327e4615a5902d12bc9403).
