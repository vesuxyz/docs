![Welcome Argent Metal](Argent_card_v2.png)

Argent has just launched **Argent Metal**, a self-custodial crypto card that makes spending USDC effortless anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Unlike other crypto cards that require preloading or custodial accounts, Argent Metal lets users **spend directly from their wallet** while maintaining full ownership of their assets.

### Why Argent Metal?

- No FX fees (1 USD = 1 USDC)
- Earn cashback rewards. Up to $1,800 in the first year.
- Exclusive perks and benefits.
- Full self-custody. Funds stay in your control until spent.

Argent Metal isn’t just powerful, it looks good too. Choose your 16g metal card in Gold or Platinum.
