In this guide you'll be taught how to claim STRK tokens earned from the DeFi Spring rewards.

**ADD BTCfi rewards, extra STRK campaign??**




### Claim STRK rewards

To get started, ensure you already have an open position on Vesu, as that is what qualifies you for STRK rewards. Please go through the [DeFi Spring section](../explore/defi-spring.md) for more information.

To claim your STRK rewards:

1. Head over to the [positions dashboard](https://vesu.xyz/positions).

2. Just above your position(s), you can see a dedicated DeFi Spring section. _Earned this week_ represents the STRKs you've accrued in the current round. _Available to claim_ is the total amount you can claim right now.

3. Click on the _Claim_ button to receive the STRK tokens.
