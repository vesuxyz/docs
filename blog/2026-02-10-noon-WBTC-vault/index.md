![WBTC yield powered by Noon Vaults](noon-wbtc-vault.png)

Bitcoin yield on Starknet keeps growing.

Following the success of the first Noon vault, the strategy now expands to WBTC.

The new Noon WBTC Vault is live on Vesu, giving Bitcoin holders a simple way to earn yield without selling or actively managing their positions.  

## The Noon WBTC Vault

This vault gives access to a smart yield strategy through a simple deposit.

Deposit WBTC. The strategy handles the rest.

Stablecoins are borrowed against the deposited Bitcoin and deployed into sUSN, Noon’s yield-bearing stablecoin. Positions are managed automatically using conservative leverage and continuous rebalancing.

The curator targets around **10% APY**.

All funds remain non-custodial and fully transparent onchain.


## About the Curator

Noon builds stablecoin yield strategies focused on sustainability and risk management.

UUSN is backed 1:1 by a mix of USDT, USDC, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Its staked version, sUSN, accrues yield directly in the token.

Noon has been live for over a year with zero downtime and no security incidents. The protocol has been audited by firms including Halborn, Hashlock, and Quantstamp.

As with any DeFi strategy, do your own research and make sure you understand the risks.

## Vesu Vaults

Vesu Vaults make advanced onchain strategies accessible without the usual complexity.

Each vault runs a strict onchain mandate and is operated by an independent curator. Funds can only be used within clearly defined strategy boundaries, and performance is fully transparent onchain.

The Vesu Vaults framework has undergone multiple independent audits. Full details are available in the [Vesu docs](https://docs.vesu.xyz/explore/vaults).
