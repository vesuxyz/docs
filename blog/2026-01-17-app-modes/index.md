![Choose your mode](app-modes.png)

Vesu has grown a lot over the last year and one interface no longer fits everyone.

More markets. More decisions.

Now you choose how you use Vesu.

## Three modes. One protocol.

Vesu now offers three app modes, each designed around a different user intent.

All modes run on the same protocol, the same smart contracts, and the same risk model.  
Only the interface changes.

## LITE

LITE is the new default experience.

It is designed to make the most common actions obvious and reduce unnecessary decision making.

- Focused on the most common actions  
- Easier to scan and get started

A simpler way to get started on Vesu.

## BTCFI

BTCFI is a Bitcoin first experience.

Designed for users who want to use Bitcoin onchain without selling.

Everything you see is centered around BTC, with no extra noise.

## PRO

PRO is the full power Vesu interface. This is exactly what existing users already know.

- All markets with full detail
- Multiply enabled  

PRO is designed for users who want full visibility and control.

## Switching modes

Switch between LITE, BTCFI, and PRO at any time.

Use the mode switch in the top right corner of the app.  
Or bookmark the link to the mode you prefer and use that directly.

Under the hood, nothing changes.  
Same security. Same risk. Same contracts.

## Try it out

This change is about focus, not limitation.
