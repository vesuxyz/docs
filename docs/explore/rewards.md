Vesu users have earned STRK rewards through Starknet Foundation ecosystem programs. The sections below describe these campaigns and their current status.

## BTCFi Season

The Starknet Foundation allocated 100 million STRK to bootstrap the BTCFi ecosystem.  
Unlike past programs that focused on static TVL, BTCFi Season rewards **active BTC usage**, especially **borrowing stablecoins against BTC collateral**.

Vesu plays a central role as the main money market where users can supply Bitcoin and borrow stablecoins directly on Starknet. The goal is to bootstrap real BTC utility, allowing Bitcoin holders to use their assets productively while staying in full self-custody.

### Eligible Markets

**BTC Collateral:**
- WBTC  
- LBTC  
- SolvBTC  
- tBTC  
- uniBTC (soon)  
- YBTC.B (soon)  

**Borrowable Stablecoins:**
- USDC  
- USDT  
- CASH  

:::note
To qualify for BTCFi rewards, stablecoins must be borrowed against eligible BTC collateral.
:::

Rewards are distributed by the Starknet Foundation to participating protocols based on activity.  
Vesu does not manage or guarantee the distribution schedule or amounts.

## DeFi Spring (Ended)

DeFi Spring was a Starknet Foundation incentive program that distributed STRK rewards to participating DeFi protocols, including Vesu.

:::info Program ended
DeFi Spring has ended. Users can still claim any unclaimed STRK rewards earned during the program **until January 31, 2026**.

### Rewards allocation

During the program, the allocation of STRK rewards depended on two factors:

1.	The amount of STRK allocated to Vesu is determined by activity metrics defined by the Starknet Foundation.
2.	Your share depends on the value of your deposits relative to the total value locked (TVL) across all participants in eligible markets over the same period.


### Eligible Markets

The following markets were eligible for DeFi Spring rewards:

- STRK
- xSTRK
- wstETH
- ETH
- USDC
- USDT

:::note
According to the Starknet Foundation’s criteria, only non-recursive deposits of stablecoins (USDC/USDT) were eligible for DeFi Spring rewards. 
:::

## Claiming Rewards
The Starknet Foundation distributes STRK rewards weekly to participating protocols.  
Once distributed, users can claim their earned share directly on Starknet via a permissionless contract.
