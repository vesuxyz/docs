![Welcome Clearstar](clearstar.png)

We’re welcoming Clearstar Labs as a new pool curator on Vesu.

Clearstar is launching their first pool on Vesu with sUSN and USDC, with plans to add more yield-bearing assets over time.

### Clearstar USDC Reactor

The Clearstar USDC Reactor is built for yield-bearing collateral, starting with sUSN as the first supported asset.

**Configuration at launch:**
- Collateral: sUSN
- Borrow: USDC
- Debt cap: $2.5M

More assets may be added to the pool over time.

### Who’s Clearstar?

Clearstar is an onchain risk curator active across major DeFi lending and vault platforms like Morpho and Euler. Their team combines TradFi and DeFi backgrounds, with a strong focus on risk, operations, and continuous monitoring.

They focus on careful asset review, setting appropriate risk parameters, and continuously monitoring the markets they curate.

### About sUSN

sUSN is the yield-bearing version of USN, a USD-backed stablecoin from Noon Capital. Yield accrues directly into the token over time, increasing its value without additional actions.

It can be used as collateral to borrow USDC or with Vesu’s Multiply feature to increase exposure to its built-in yield.

### Get started

You can now use the Clearstar pool to:
