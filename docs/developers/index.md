# Welcome to the Vesu V2 Developer Documentation

The Vesu V2 lending protocol is the next iteration of the Vesu lending protocol, Starknet's most trusted lending market. The Vesu V2 protocol builds on the same concepts than the V1 protocol but makes a number of different design decisions in order to maximize simplicity and security.
