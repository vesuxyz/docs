Starknet's DeFi Spring program started in [February 2024](https://www.starknet.io/blog/starknet-foundation-introduces-the-start-of-defi-spring) with the goal of bootstrapping a strong and healthy DeFi ecosystem on Starknet. Initially a budget of 40M STRK tokens was allocated to the program with a timeline until October 2024.

Recently, the program was expanded to **a total of 90M STRK tokens, with the aim of continuing until all rewards are distributed, which is expected to extend into Q2 2025**.

Vesu users are eligible for STRK rewards. This means that you can earn STRK tokens for supplying liquidity on certain Vesu markets.

### What are DeFi Spring rewards?

The Starknet Foundation allocates STRK rewards to participating protocols, such as Vesu, based on a set of activity metrics. These metrics determine the weekly distribution of STRK tokens to each protocol. For more information, visit the official [DeFi Spring](https://defispring.starknet.io/about) page.

### How can I earn STRK on Vesu?

Simply supply assets to any of the [eligible markets](#which-markets-are-eligible).

:::note
According to the Starknet Foundation’s criteria, only non-recursive deposits of stablecoins (USDC/USDT) are eligible for STRK rewards. For example, if you deposit USDC and borrow USDT, you’ll still earn the organic Supply APY on your USDC, but you won’t receive any extra STRK rewards due to the USDT debt.

### How is my STRK allocation determined?

Your allocation of STRK tokens depends on two factors:

1. The total amount of STRK distributed to Vesu is based on a set of metrics that are defined and monitored by the Starknet Foundation.
2. Your share is determined by the value of your deposited assets relative to the total value locked (TVL) across all participants in eligible markets over a given period.

You can track your total interest earnings (across all markets) on the [Vesu Leaderboard](./leaderboard.md).
