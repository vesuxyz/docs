## Pool Risk

The "Alterscope CASH" pool is curated by Alterscope, a professional risk curator currently operating vaults on Euler and offering autonomous risk agents across various chains and platforms.

The pool uses Vesu's audited factory extension which leverages a robust Pragma feed and Vesu's public liquidation model.

Alterscope has the permission to pause the pool in an emergency situation and update various parameters including debt caps and liquidation loan-to-value retios. 

Given Alterscope's expertise in assessing, monitoring and managing DeFi risks and their operational setup, including a multisig owning the pool permissions, the pool risk is deemed low.

## Asset Risk

'CASH' is a USD-pegged stablecoin that is issued natively on Starknet through the Opus Protocol, a CDP system inspired by [Liquity's LUSD](https://liquity.org).

The Opus Protocol and 'CASH' stablecoin are relatively new, officially launched in September 2024, and thus lack a long track record, TVL, user base and price history.

Nonetheless, the protocol has performed without any incident and safely navigated through major market stress scenarios since its inception.

**Smart contract risk**

The Opus protocol smart contracts have been audited by Trail of Bits, a top-tier auditing firm, as well as in a public Code4rena contest in January/February 2024.

However, the protocol was only deployed on Starknet mainnet in July 2024 with a significant code diff in the GitHub repository between the audits and the version as of July. Since contracts are not verified on public block explorers, it is not possible to verify the deployed version of the protocol.

Information on the existing audits can be found in the official Opus documentation [here](https://docs.opus.money/current/technical-documentation/security/external).

:::warning
The Opus Protocol contracts are not verified on block explorers.

N/A

**Depeg risk**

'CASH' is a relatively new stablecoin with only limited price history (about 3 months at the time of writing this report). In its first weeks, the price of 'CASH' seemingly stabilized at a level slightly below its peg of 1.0 USD (around 0.995 USD) according to [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/opus-cash).

:::warning
Given its low circulating supply and liquidity, there exists a considerable depeg risk. 
:::

This risk is mitigated in the *Alterscope CASH* pool by enabling 'CASH' only as a loan asset, but not as collateral asset, and using a fixed oracle price of 1 USD/CASH.

The proposed rating is:

## Oracle Risk

The pool uses Pragma's `FIXEDRESERVED/USD` price feed, returning a fixed price of 1 USD (per 'CASH'). The feed is thus not subject to Oracle manipulation attacks.
The Pragma oracle is a native Starknet oracle system that secures over USD 200m across all major projects on Starknet.
It is fully decentralized in that it does not rely on off-chain infrastructure. Instead, data providers directly push prices on-chain and aggregation is done by the data consumer directly.

**Smart contract risk**

Find an overview of the Pragma smart contract system [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle?tab=readme-ov-file#overview).

The Pragma smart contracts have been audited by Nethermind and both the [source code](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle) and [audit report](https://github.com/astraly-labs/pragma-oracle/tree/main/audits) are publicly available.

**Price composition & source diversity**

The `FIXEDRESERVED/USD`-feed returns a fixed price of 1 USD and does thus not rely on actual spot price sources.

**Oracle fail-safes**

No autonomous oracle fail-safes and fallbacks are configured. Alterscope monitors and pauses pools manually in case of an emergency.

## Market Risk

'CASH' deposits in this pool can be borrowed with a variety of collateral assets.

Liquidations, as per the used official factory extension (see Section *Pool Risk*), are public and prioritize rapid liquidations.

However, liquidations may be delayed or unprofitable due to very thin liquidity for 'CASH'. This risk is mitigated with strict *debt caps* and *liquidation discounts*.

Furthermore, since 'CASH' debt is valued at a fixed price of 1 USD/CASH (see Section *Oracle Risk*) a depeg of 'CASH' to >1 USD can result in unprofitable liquidations. This is unlikely though, as such market inefficiencies would be promptly closed by arbitrageurs.

**Rating**

The proposed rating is:

- ðŸŸ¨ Medium


## Collateral Risk

The pool enables borrowing of `CASH` with a set of collateral assets, which themselves all achieve a "Low" rating. Collateral *rehypothecation* is not enabled in the pool. 

The proposed rating is:

- ðŸŸ© Low
