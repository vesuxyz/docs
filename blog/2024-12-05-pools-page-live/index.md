## The New Pools Page Is Here: A New Chapter for Vesu!

The wait is over: Vesu's new **Pools Page** is live! This update empowers anyone to create custom lending pools, opening up new opportunities for creators, curators, and users alike. 

### Whatâ€™s New?

The Pools Page makes it easier than ever to create and manage lending pools. Anyone can now launch new markets, no technical expertise or approval from others required. Youâ€™re in control! Customize your pool to align with your vision and goals.

Choose to make your pool immutable or if you want to enable pool emergency procedures, giving borrowers and lenders extra trust in its stability & security. Prefer a flexible approach? Curate your pool as it grows and be able to adjust settings to meet evolving needs.
