## New Curator and Asset

We’re excited to welcome CarmineDAO as a new curator on Vesu. From Carmine Finance to RemusDEX, they’ve helped shape Starknet DeFi from the start. Now, they bring that experience to Vesu by curating the first lending market for DOG, one of the first Bitcoin Runes on Starknet. More may follow.

## CarmineDAO Runes Pool

**Collateral**: DOG, ETH, STRK, USDC, WBTC  
**Borrow**: DOG, ETH, STRK, USDC, WBTC

All assets can be used as collateral or borrowed against one another.
Whether you’re holding DOG or ETH, WBTC or STRK, you can now unlock liquidity or build custom cross-asset strategies.

Collateral remains isolated to your position. No rehypothecation.

## About the Curator

CarmineDAO is a long-standing builder on Starknet. After launching Carmine Finance, they’ve continued to grow the ecosystem with community-led initiatives.

One of those is RemusDEX, a fully on-chain Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) DEX built by a small team from within the CarmineDAO community. RemusDEX uses a CLOB model, enabling traders to place limit and market orders with full transparency and control.

DOG is the first Bitcoin Rune traded on RemusDEX and is now supported on Vesu through this new lending pool.
