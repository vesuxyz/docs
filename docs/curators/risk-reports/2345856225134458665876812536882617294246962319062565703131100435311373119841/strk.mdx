## Summary

The Vesu STRK-Re7xSTRK market represents STRK deposits in Re7 Lab's "Re7 xSTRK" pool.

The pool enables `STRK` and `xSTRK`, Endur's `STRK` LST, assets and uses Vesu's official factory extension with Pragma price feeds.

The market's overall risk rating is 游릳 Medium.

## Pool Risk

The "Re7 xSTRK" pool is curated by Re7 Labs, a professional risk curator with extensive experience and a long track record on other lending protocols.

The pool uses Vesu's audited factory extension which uses a robust Pragma feed and Vesu's public liquidation model.

Re7 Labs has the permission to pause the pool in an emergency situation and update various parameters including debt caps and liquidation loan-to-value retios. 

Given Re7 Labs' extensive risk curation experience and their operational setup, including a multisig and real-time monitoring with Hypernative, the pool risk is deemed low.

## Asset Risk

:::warning
This report does not assess the risks associated with bridging assets to Starknet using StarkGate.
Make sure you understand the risks involved with bridging assets to Starknet before continuing.
:::

StarkGate STRK reflects Ethereum mainnet STRK that is bridged to Starknet using the StarkGate bridge. 
StarkGate is Starknet's canonical bridge and is developed and maintained by StarkWare, the creator of Starknet.
The bridge is operational since early 2022 and has facilitated over [1.9M bridge transactions](https://dune.com/sapiens/starknet-insighttokenomics-and-bridge-stats) or over USD 1.7bn in value bridged.

**Smart contract risk**

StarkGate STRK uses OpenZeppelin's [standard ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts) token implementation.
It has been audited by Nethermind and both [source code](https://github.com/starknet-io/starkgate-contracts) and [audit report](https://github.com/NethermindEth/PublicAuditReports/blob/main/NM0064-DRAFT_STARKGATE.pdf) are publicly available.

:::warning
The StarkGate STRK contract is not verified on block explorers.

## Oracle Risk

The pool uses Pragma's `STRK/USD` price feed.
The Pragma oracle is a native Starknet oracle system that secures over USD 200m across all major projects on Starknet.
It is fully decentralized in that it does not rely on off-chain infrastructure. Instead, data providers directly push prices on-chain and aggregation is done by the data consumer directly.

**Smart contract risk**

Find an overview of the Pragma smart contract system [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle?tab=readme-ov-file#overview).

The Pragma smart contracts have been audited by Nethermind and both the [source code](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle) and [audit report](https://github.com/astraly-labs/pragma-oracle/tree/main/audits) are publicly available.

**Price composition & source diversity**

The oracle price is computed as the Median over the most recent data points available for the various Pragma providers.

**Oracle fail-safes**

N/A

Re7 Labs actively monitors the pool and oracle feeds and in case of an emergency pauses deposits and withdrawals.

## Market Risk

`STRK` deposits can be borrowed with `xSTRK` as collateral.

However, the pool uses Pragma's `STRK/USD` price feed to price the `xSTRK` collateral. 
Liquidations can thus only be triggered by interest accruals exceeding the lending pair's *liquidation loan-to-value* ratio.

Market risk, the risk from bad debt incurred by failed liquidations, can thus be neglected. Instead, the main risk arises from `xSTRK` depegs.

The proposed rating is:

- 游릴 Low


## Collateral Risk

The pool enables borrowing of `STRK` with `xSTRK` collateral. The vSTRK-Re7xSTRK market thus inherits `xSTRK`'s asset risk.

The proposed rating is:

- 游릳 Medium
