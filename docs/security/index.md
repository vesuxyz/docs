For further inquiries please reach out to [security@vesu.xyz](mailto:security@vesu.xyz).

## Access & Custody

Vesu is a non-custodial lending protocol.  
Funds are never held by Vesu and are accessible directly onchain.

If the main Vesu website is unavailable, positions remain accessible through the  
[Fallback UI](https://lite.vesu.xyz). It interacts directly with the smart contracts and allows viewing or closing positions without relying on external services.
