## Pool Risk

The "Alterscope wstETH" pool is curated by Alterscope, a professional risk curator currently operating vaults on Euler and offering autonomous risk agents across various chains and platforms.

The pool uses Vesu's audited factory extension which leverages a robust Pragma feed and Vesu's public liquidation model.

Alterscope has the permission to pause the pool in an emergency situation and update various parameters including debt caps and liquidation loan-to-value ratios. 

Given Alterscope's expertise in assessing, monitoring and managing DeFi risks and their operational setup, including a multisig owning the pool permissions, the pool risk is deemed low.

## Asset Risk

:::warning
This report does not assess the risks associated with bridging assets to Starknet using StarkGate.
Make sure you understand the risks involved with bridging assets to Starknet before continuing.
:::

StarkGate WBTC reflects Ethereum mainnet WBTC that is bridged to Starknet using the StarkGate bridge. 
StarkGate is Starknet's canonical bridge and is developed and maintained by StarkWare, the creator of Starknet.
The bridge is operational since early 2022 and has facilitated over [1.9M bridge transactions](https://dune.com/sapiens/starknet-insighttokenomics-and-bridge-stats) or over USD 1.7bn in value bridged.

**Smart contract risk**

StarkGate WBTC uses OpenZeppelin's [standard ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts) token implementation.
It has been audited by Nethermind and both [source code](https://github.com/starknet-io/starkgate-contracts) and [audit report](https://github.com/NethermindEth/PublicAuditReports/blob/main/NM0064-DRAFT_STARKGATE.pdf) are publicly available.

:::warning
The StarkGate WBTC contract is not verified on block explorers.

## Oracle Risk

The pool uses Pragma's `WBTC/USD` price feed.
The Pragma oracle is a native Starknet oracle system that secures over USD 200m across all major projects on Starknet.
It is fully decentralized in that it does not rely on off-chain infrastructure. Instead, data providers directly push prices on-chain and aggregation is done by the data consumer directly.

**Smart contract risk**

Find an overview of the Pragma smart contract system [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle?tab=readme-ov-file#overview).

The Pragma smart contracts have been audited by Nethermind and both the [source code](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle) and [audit report](https://github.com/astraly-labs/pragma-oracle/tree/main/audits) are publicly available.

**Price composition & source diversity**

The oracle price is computed as the Median over the most recent data points available for the various Pragma providers.

**Oracle fail-safes**

No autonomous oracle fail-safes and fallbacks are configured. Alterscope monitors and pauses pools manually in case of an emergency.

**Rating**

The proposed rating is:

## Market Risk

`WBTC` deposits can be borrowed with `wstETH` as collateral.

The pool enforces *debt caps* and *liquidation discounts* reflecting the on-chain liquidity available for liquidations.

Liquidations, as per the used official factory extension (see Section *Pool Risk*), are public and prioritize rapid liquidations.

The resulting market risk is computed using the [Standard Market Risk Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zU9IRKCX8xicSNd4UV78hMEw_rf-ZtGL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108086377410680948516&rtpof=true&sd=true).

The proposed rating is:

- 游릴 Low


## Collateral Risk

The pool enables borrowing of `WBTC` only with `wstETH` collateral, which itself achieves a "Low" rating. Collateral *rehypothecation* is not enabled in the pool. 

The proposed rating is:

- 游릴 Low
