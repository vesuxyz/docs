If you are the Curator of a Vesu pool, that is not immutable, you can update the configuration e.g. of interest rate parameters as market conditions change.

In order to update the configuration of an existing pool, follow the steps below:

1. Head over to the Vesu Pools [page](https://vesu.xyz/pools).
2. Connect your Starknet wallet. The pools you have the Curator role for will be highlighted.
3. Select the pool you want to update to open the pool configuration wizard.
4. Use the wizard to navigate to the parameter(s) that you want to update and update the values.
5. Once completed, confirm and execute the “Update Pool” transaction.
