# Getting started as a vault curator

Vesu Vaults let anyone launch and manage automated yield strategies on Starknet. As a curator, you define how the vault works, what assets it uses, where the capital goes, and how it earns yield. This enables strategies for different use cases from "simple" basis trades to BTCfi and levered yield farming.

Vaults run on audited smart contracts, with trust-minimized controls and onchain enforcement. You focus on designing the strategy, the infra handles the rest.

## Getting started

## Vault listing

Vesu Vaults are permissionless, anyone can deploy a strategy. But to get your vault featured on the main app (and gain visibility), it needs to go through a short review process. Here’s how listing currently works:

1. Collect and review curator information
2. Collect and review strategy information
3. Whitelisting of the Vault on the Vesu App
