# Welcome to Vesu

Vesu is a fully open and permissionless lending protocol built on [Starknet](https://starknet.io). Users can supply crypto assets (earn), borrow crypto assets and build new lending experiences on Vesu without relying on intermediaries. The Vesu lending protocol is not controlled by a governance body and there exists no governance token. Instead, Vesu is built as a public infrastructure giving everyone equal access to all functions and is free for everyone to use.
