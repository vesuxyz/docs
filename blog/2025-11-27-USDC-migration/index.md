Starknet is introducing native USDC, the official version issued by Circle. This post gives you everything you need to know so you are ready on day one. Migration begins next week. Here’s what to expect.

## What you need to know

:::info TL;DR
- All USDC.e and V1 positions will need to migrate to native USDC and V2 pools.
- Rewards on USDC.e stop once migration begins.
- The migration tool goes live on December 3.
:::

Native USDC becomes the stablecoin standard on Starknet, so Vesu is upgrading all USDC markets in V2. Any positions using USDC.e and any remaining V1 pools (including Genesis) will need to move into their native USDC and V2 equivalents.

Rewards for USDC.e will stop once the migration starts and all new liquidity and incentives will run on V2 markets. Migrating early keeps your positions active and aligned with the updated pools.

A guided migration tool goes live on December 3. You migrate your own positions, but the flow is simple. Affected positions will be clearly marked in the app and you can click through the steps to complete the move in a few moments. 

## Benefits of native USDC

Until now, all USDC on Starknet has been bridged through StarkGate, creating the wrapped version known as USDC.e. Native USDC is different. It is issued directly by Circle and comes with clear benefits:

- One unified, canonical USDC  
- Lower risk and fewer trust assumptions  
- Fully reserved and redeemable 1:1  
- Faster, cleaner cross-chain transfers through CCTP  
- Institutional on/off-ramps via Circle Mint  

It is the version exchanges, custodians and market makers prefer.  
For Starknet and for Vesu, this means cleaner liquidity and a more reliable setup for earning with USDC and borrowing it against Bitcoin, Ethereum and other assets.

## Next steps
There’s nothing you need to do right now. Just check back on Wednesday when the migration starts on vesu.xyz. 

We’ll post the exact go-live announcement on X and Discord once everything is ready.
