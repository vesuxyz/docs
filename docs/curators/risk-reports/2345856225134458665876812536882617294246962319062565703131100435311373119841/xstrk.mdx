## Pool Risk

The "Re7 xSTRK" pool is curated by Re7 Labs, a professional risk curator with extensive experience and a long track record on other lending protocols.

The pool uses Vesu's audited factory extension which uses a robust Pragma feed and Vesu's public liquidation model.

Re7 Labs has the permission to pause the pool in an emergency situation and update various parameters including debt caps and liquidation loan-to-value retios. 

Given Re7 Labs' extensive risk curation experience and their operational setup, including a multisig and real-time monitoring with Hypernative, the pool risk is deemed low.

## Asset Risk

Endur's `xSTRK` is a `STRK` *liquid staking token* (LST) and was launched in November 2024 by the teams behind Karnot and STRKFarm.

At the time of writing this report, almost 15M `STRK` is staked with Endur making it one of the biggest `STRK` staker.

Because of its recent launch only limited information and historical data points exist for `xSTRK`.


**Smart contract risk**

:::info
The `xSTRK` codebase has been audited and both the codebase and audit report shared with and reviewed by the Starknet Foundation.
:::

:::warning
The `xSTRK` codebase and audit reports are not publicly available.
:::

:::warning
The `xSTRK` contract is not verified on block explorers.
:::

**Counterparty risk**

As a `STRK` LST, `xSTRK` gives the holder a claim on the underlying `STRK` assets. These assets are managed by Endur's staking infrastructure.

As the operator of this infrastructure, the Endur team plays a critical role in the safeguarding of these assets and is thus considered an important counterparty to anyone holding or integrating with `xSTRK`.

The Endur team has proven experience of operating blockchain and DeFi infrastructure as well as a good reputation within the Starknet ecosystem. The counterparty risk is thus limited.

**Depeg risk**

`xSTRK` trades on the Ekubo DEX and its price is expected to be pegged to the price of `STRK` itself.

Given that the asset was only launched in November 2024 and still has thin liquidity on Ekubo, temporary depeg events are expected.

A permanent depeg event could be caused by a loss or theft of the LST's underlying staked `STRK` balance. However, this risk is limited given the findings in the previous sections.

**Rating**

The proposed rating is:

- 游릳 Medium


## Oracle Risk

The pool uses Pragma's `STRK/USD` price feed.

The Pragma oracle is a native Starknet oracle system that secures over USD 200m across all major projects on Starknet.
It is fully decentralized in that it does not rely on off-chain infrastructure. Instead, data providers directly push prices on-chain and aggregation is done by the data consumer directly.

**Smart contract risk**

Find an overview of the Pragma smart contract system [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle?tab=readme-ov-file#overview).

The Pragma smart contracts have been audited by Nethermind and both the [source code](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle) and [audit report](https://github.com/astraly-labs/pragma-oracle/tree/main/audits) are publicly available.

**Price composition & source diversity**

The oracle price is computed as the Median over the most recent data points available for the various Pragma providers.

**Oracle fail-safes**

N/A

Re7 Labs actively monitors the pool and oracle feeds and in case of an emergency pauses deposits and withdrawals.
