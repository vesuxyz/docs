We’re welcoming Clearstar Labs as a new pool curator on Vesu.

Clearstar is launching their first pool on Vesu with sUSN and USDC, with plans to add more yield-bearing assets over time.

### Who’s Clearstar?

Clearstar is an onchain risk curator active across major DeFi lending and vault platforms like Morpho and Euler. Their team combines TradFi and DeFi backgrounds, with a strong focus on risk, operations, and continuous monitoring.

In short: they care about configs, edge cases, and what breaks in practice — not just headline numbers.

### Why this pool?

sUSN is already live on Vesu. This pool is about adding capacity and curator diversity, not replacing existing markets.

Clearstar’s broader goal is to bring more yield-bearing collateral to Vesu under a consistent risk framework — starting with a familiar asset and expanding from there.
