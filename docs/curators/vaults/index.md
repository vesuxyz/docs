# Getting started as a vault curator

Vesu Vaults empower curators to set up and manage yield strategies on top of Vesu Pools and other yield sources. The implementation of these Vaults allows for a wide range of yield strategies with different trust assumptions towards the curator. This enables curators to design strategies towards different use cases from "simple" basis trades to BTCfi and levered yield farming.

## Getting started

We recommend every new curator to first read the basics of Vesu Vaults [here](/curators/vaults/basics) and the Vault listing process [here](/curators/vaults/list-vault). If you have questions around curating Vaults, get in touch with our Support [here](https://discord.com/invite/G9Gxgujj8T).

If you are ready to launch your first Vault, proceed with the following steps:

1. Set up accounts for the Vault Owner and Manager roles.
2. Create your Vault as explained [here](/curators/vaults/create-vault).
3. List your Vault as explained [here](/curators/vaults/list-vault).
4. Optionally, you can also launch your own reward program as explained [here](/curators/rewards).

## Vault listing

Vesu Vaults is a permissionless protocol and allows anyone to set up and curate yield strategies. However, for quality and security reasons, Vaults need to go through a listing process in order to be included in the Vesu App. This process is currently manual and involves the following steps:

1. Collect and review curator information
2. Collect and review strategy information
3. Whitelisting of the Vault on the Vesu App
