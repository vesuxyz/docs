Lite mode is a simplified interface for **Earn** and **Borrow** on Vesu.

It’s built for users who want clear defaults and fewer decisions.

- Earn & Borrow
- Vaults (same across all modes)
- No Multiply

## How Lite mode works

### One recommended market per asset
For each asset (USDC, ETH, WBTC, etc.), Lite mode shows **one default market**.

These are:
- Pre-selected
- Curated
- Suitable for most users


### Simplified market information
Lite mode shows only essential data.

**Shown**
- Total supplied
- Total borrowed
- Supply APR
- Borrow APR
- Collateral assets

**Hidden (by design)**
- Utilization
- Contract addresses
- Advanced risk configuration
- Detailed collateral routing

For full control and visibility, switch to **Pro mode**.
