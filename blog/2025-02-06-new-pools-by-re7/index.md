![New Pools by Re7 Labs](re7-new-pools-blog.png)

Big update! Two new pools, curated by Re7 Labs, are now live—offering fresh opportunities for earning, borrowing, and optimizing capital efficiency. 

And there’s more—DeFi Spring rewards for wstETH start today, Feb 6, 2025, giving an extra boost to yield opportunities in one of the pools!

Re7 Labs, known for their expertise as a leading risk curator, first launched their curated pools on Vesu in November. Learn more in our previous [Blog post](/blog/2024-11-27-welcome-re7/). 

Now, let’s take a closer look at the two pools launching today and what they bring to the table.

## Re7 Starknet Ecosystem Pool
**Collateral:** EKUBO, STRK  
**Borrow:** USDC

This is the first pool on Vesu where EKUBO can be used as collateral—a long-requested feature. It introduces a new way for EKUBO holders to access liquidity.

To ensure a controlled launch, Re7 Labs has set an initial debt cap of 9,000 USDC for the EKUBO-USDC pair and 2M USDC for the STRK-USDC pair.

The curator can adjust this pool as needed—raising the debt cap or adding more tokens from the Starknet ecosystem, ensuring it remains aligned with market needs and long-term stability.

## Re7 wstETH Pool
**Collateral:** wstETH  
**Borrow/Multiply with:** ETH

The pool is designed to maximize wstETH exposure with Vesu’s Multiply feature, allowing users to boost yield by capturing both staking rewards and the DeFi Spring rewards starting today.

:::info 
While strongly correlated, ETH and wstETH prices (and the Pragma price feeds) can deviate in particular in a stressed market environment. Users are responsible for ensuring enough buffer in their position to account for price differences between the two tokens on Starknet.

## The Strengths of Vesu’s Infrastructure

Both pools leverage Vesu’s fully customizable lending architecture, allowing the curator to design pools that adapt to evolving market needs. Debt caps can be adjusted based on demand to keep the pools balanced and secure.

The parameters of each pool can be accessed via the [Pools page](https://vesu.xyz/pools).

Since Vesu’s pools are isolated, risks stay within each pool without affecting others. This keeps borrowing and lending safer, even as more assets are added.
